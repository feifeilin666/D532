# D532 - Final Project

## Stock Portfolio Tracker
Our team, Group 9, has decided to create a stock portfolio tracker from historical stock data that will allow the user to update their portfolio and see how their changes have impacted the projected portfolio performance based on historical trends. 
## Project Description
### Team
Group 9 (Dustin Cole, Feifei Lin, Lee Johnson)
### Objectives
Our project is aimed at beginner stock traders who want to understand the impact of their portfolio decisions. The user will have the ability to add/delete stocks from their portfolio, change the amount of shares they own, change a sell/buy recommendation, or create different performance scenarios. This tracker is aimed at those who want to clearly see the performance of their stock portfolio while being able to look at different scenarios to help make buy/sell decisions. The primary problem we are trying to solve is to create an incentive for people to invest more. The simplicity and ease of use of our tracker will help overcome some common barriers to investing including not understanding the future impact of certain investment decisions. 
### Usefulness
Our tracker will be useful due to its ease of use and the ability to see performance projections based on the userâ€™s investment decisions. Similar databases may exist as part of services offered by online stockbrokers (TD Ameritrade, Etrade, etc.), but unlike these other services, our tracker will help the beginner stock trader make better investment decisions via our projected performance visualizations, buy/sell recommendations, and scenario creation functionality.
### Dataset
~33K records. The dataset includes the company name, symbol, and historical volume and price data. For our proof of concept, we have selected Europe/Asia Tech Mega/Large/Medium NYSE stocks from Nasdaq.com. This is historical data for public use (stock trends, reference, etc.).
